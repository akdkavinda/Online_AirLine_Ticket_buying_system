# Online_AirLine_Ticket_buying_system
Our team has successfully developed an online airline ticket purchasing system web application as a result of 1st year 2nd semester group project in IWT module. The MVC architecture was used to create this web application. The project's major goal was to make the process of creating tickets as simple as possible.


 - Main Functions are :
- Login
- Create an Account
- create a ticket
- select the options(Destination, Date, numbers of passangers, name address and personal details) 
- download the ticket
- checkin
